- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**: A fast build tool that provides a quicker and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or [Bun](https://bun.sh/)) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or if you are using bun
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
or if you are using bun
```bash
bun run dev
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:5173`. You can now view the application in your browser.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
.
├── public/              # Static assets
├── src/
│   ├── assets/          # Image and other assets
│   ├── components/      # Reusable UI components
│   ├── lib/             # Utility functions
│   ├── routes/          # Route definitions for TanStack Router
│   ├── main.tsx         # Main entry point of the application
│   └── index.css        # Global CSS styles
├── package.json         # Project metadata and dependencies
└── vite.config.ts       # Vite configuration
```

## 部署 (Deployment)

To build the application for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```
or if you are using bun
```bash
bun run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with the optimized and minified production-ready code. You can then deploy the contents of the `dist` folder to your hosting provider of choice.
